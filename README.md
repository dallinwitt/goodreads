# Unsupervised Machine Learning: 
# Clustering of Books Based on Goodreads Summary

The goal of this project was to create a TF-IDF matrix for words used in Goodreads summaries, and deploy an unsupervised ML model that could cluster the books into n distinct groups. 

Obviously, unlike a supervised ML algorithm, there is not a quantitative way to measure the effectiveness of this clustering, but examining the clusters seems to reveal an effective and logical categorication of the books. 

A system like this could be scaled up to help build out a recommendation algorithm, or to partially automate categorication of new titles.
