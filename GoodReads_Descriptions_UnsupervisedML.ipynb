    "# Introduction\n",
    "The goal of this project was to create an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that could cluster books together with other books of a similar topic. Categorization tasks are frustrating and time-consuming to do by hand, and automating a large part of it, even if the results are imperfect, would make the task significantly easier and faster.\n",
    "# 1 Load Data\n",
    "## 1.1 Package Importing\n",
    "For this project we will do all of the data manipulation using Pandas. The machine learning component will all be handled using Scikit-Learn. TfidfVectorizer will convert the list of texts into a term frequency / inverse document frequnecy vector. The TruncatedSVD package will truncate the vector to the 1000 most useful terms for categorization (based on their values in the TF-IDF matrix. We will used the KMeans method to cluster the data, and we will construct a data pipeline using sklearn's make_pipeline."

       "['\\n  A Rise and Fall of the Great Powers for the post–Cold War era—a brilliantly written, sweeping new history of how empires have ebbed and flowed over the past six centuries. \\n\\xa0The death of the great Tatar emperor Tamerlane in 1405, writes historian John Darwin, was a turning point in world history. Never again would a single warlord, raiding across the steppes, be able to unite Eurasia under his rule. After Tamerlane, a series of huge, stable empires were founded and consolidated— Chinese, Mughal, Persian, and Ottoman—realms of such grandeur, sophistication, and dynamism that they outclassed the fragmentary, quarrelsome nations of Europe in every respect. The nineteenth century saw these empires fall vulnerable to European conquest, creating an age of anarchy and exploitation, but this had largely ended by the twenty-first century, with new Chinese and Indian super-states and successful independent states in Turkey and Iran. \\xa0This elegantly written, magisterial account challenges the conventional narrative of the “Rise of the West,” showing that European ascendancy was neither foreordained nor a linear process. Indeed, it is likely to be a transitory phase. After Tamerlane is a vivid, bold, and innovative history of how empires rise and fall, from one of Britain’s leading scholars. It will take its place beside other provocative works of “large history,” from Paul Kennedy’s The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers to David Landes’s The Wealth and Poverty of Nations or Niall Ferguson’s Empire.

       " 'In Inka Bodies and the Body of Christ Carolyn Dean investigates the multiple meanings of the Roman Catholic feast of Corpus Christi as it was performed in the Andean city of Cuzco after the Spanish conquest. By concentrating on the era’s paintings and its historical archives, Dean explores how the festival celebrated the victory of the Christian God over sin and death, the triumph of Christian orthodoxy over the imperial Inka patron (the Sun), and Spain’s conquest of Peruvian society. \\tAs Dean clearly illustrates, the central rite of the festival—the taking of the Eucharist—symbolized both the acceptance of Christ and the power of the colonizers over the colonized. The most remarkable of Andean celebrants were those who appeared costumed as the vanquished Inka kings of Peru’s pagan past. Despite the subjugation of the indigenous population, Dean shows how these and other Andean nobles used the occasion of Corpus Christi as an opportunity to construct new identities through tinkuy, a native term used to describe the conjoining of opposites. By mediating the chasms between the Andean region and Europe, pagans and Christians, and the past and the present, these Andean elites negotiated a new sense of themselves. Dean moves beyond the colonial period to examine how these hybrid forms of Inka identity are still evident in the festive life of modern Cuzco. Inka Bodies and the Body of Christ offers the first in-depth analysis of the culture and paintings of colonial Cuzco. This volume will be welcomed by historians of Peruvian culture, art, and politics. It will also interest those engaged in performance studies, religion, and postcolonial and Latin American studies.',\n",

Maggy Whitehouse, whose workshop courses in Kabbalah and radio lectures reach millions, shows that this ancient spiritual practice belongs not to any one religion but to all humanity. This lucid and user-friendly interpretation of Kabbalah’s central symbols, the Tree of Life and Jacob’s Ladder, will help readers enhance their awareness of how the universe works and the meaning of their own lives within it. Whitehouse also shows how Kabbalah offers a path to spirituality that involves the idea of a Cosmic Being and a Divine plan outside the conventional teachings of religion, and ultimately a way to create happiness according to our inner being, instead of our ego’s wishes.']"
